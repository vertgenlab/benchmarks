# gonomics

To run benchmarks the gonomics binaries (specifically simulateSam) and samtools must be installed and in PATH. Pysam must also be installed.

Once dependencies are installed, execute runBenchmarks.sh to replicate benchmarks. 

To benchmark gonomics intervalOverlap against bedtools and bedops, please review bedtoolsbedopsIntervalOverlap/benchmarkBed.sh
